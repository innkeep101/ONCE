# **ONCE**
Part 1/VII

*By E.I. Werner*

---

Once, 

Only one, only Darkness.

At once, Light declares Itself. 

Light severs one to two, before to after.

Light is holy.

Light is whole.

Light is Itself. 

In It, no Darkness.

Darkness yearns, yearns to be one again. 

Darkness swallows, swallows Light.

Singular seed.

Still, Light loves. 

Loves to be and become.

One seed cannot contain It.

White Light shines and shatters. 

A golden Sun emerges.

Sun loves. 

Loves to be and bestow Itself.

Sun bestows of Itself six children, planets to behold It.

Six children dance and dance around Sun.

Only beheld, Darkness cannot claim them.
