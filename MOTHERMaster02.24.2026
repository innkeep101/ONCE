# MOTHER
Part II/VII

*By E.I. Werner*

---

Six children Sun bestows of Itself.
One unlike Her brothers.
She, the only Daughter of Sun.
Sun beholds Itself glimmering,

Glimmering in Her sweet waters.

She dances and dances,

Until She dances where She began.
There, She beholds Sun without shadow,

So beholds Her own.

She twirls and twirls,

To shed Her shadow.
She weeps and weeps.
Shame does not release Her.

Twin tears fall and fall, 

To edge and edge.

Sweet and salt, 

Glimmer and shadow,

Awe and shame.

Son and son born, 

So Daughter become Mother.
